		<h4> Arduino Project</h4>
		<p> This was a recent project I completed with a group of five people. We brainstormed as a team to come up with ideas for an engineering project. We finally decided on creating a pool surface clearner inspired by the iRobot Roomba. I had to independently learn wire and operate an arduino UNO. I also had to learn how to program the Arduino myself. My other group members helped with modelling and building of the body of the robot. Our final product ran perfectly but only in warm water. This was a great experience for me to work cooperatively in a team.</p>

		<h4>Matlab Image Processing</h4>
		<p>I learned about the Mandebrot Set and how it works. After that, I had to learn how to traverse the mandelbrot set on Matlab with the help of other external programs. After everything was rendered, I editted the video on Adobe Premier and After Effects.  </p>

		<h4>C++ Checkers Game</h4>
		<p> This was my first programming project. We used C++ on our first year of university to learn about the basics of programming. For this project, We had to use the concept of arrays and file reading to create a text based checkers game. I used Microsoft Visual Studio to program the game.</p>

		<h4> There will be more projects to come!</h4>
